# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app that allows you to schedule tasks for your work day. It provides a visual representation of your tasks for the current day, distinguishing between past, present, and future tasks.

## Features

- Easily distinguish between past, present, and future tasks based on the current time.
- Save your tasks locally to view and edit them even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript
- Day.js for time management
- Local Storage for data persistence

## Usage

1. Open the Work Day Scheduler in your web browser.
2. The scheduler will display time slots for different hours of the workday.
3. Time slots in the past will be displayed with a gray background, the current hour with a red background, and future hours with a green background.
4. Click on the text area for a specific hour to enter your task for that hour.
5. Click the "Save" button to save your task. It will be stored locally and will persist even after refreshing the page.
6. To add a new task in a future time slot, click the "Add Task" button and enter your task details.
7. Click "Save" to save the new task.
